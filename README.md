# smartblinds
A home automation project retrofitting existing blinds to be IoT controlled, through the power of Arduino and Apple HomeKit.

This repo contains the Arduino files uploaded to the EPS32 to make the blinds work, along with the .stls of the 3D printed parts. To read more about this project, check out my portfolio page on it [here](https://www.brianbrown.io/smart-blinds).
